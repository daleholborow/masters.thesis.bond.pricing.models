GUIDE TO MATLAB FILES

Files are of two types.  Programs do calculations for a variety of tasks,
including numbers and figures for notes, answers to assignments, and tests
of routines.  Procedures (functions) do specialized tasks that we find
convenient to organize in files:  Black-Scholes formula, calibrate BDT, etc.
Details on the latter are available in Matlab's help facility:  type "help x"
for help on procedure x.  To run a program, simply type its name in Matlab.
Eg, adlec4 runs the program adlec4.m.

Programs
     adlecn.m       numbers and figures for lecture n
     ans99s.m       calculations for assignments (spring 99)

Statistical procedures
     acf.m          autocorrelation function
     moments.m      mean, st dev, skewness, kurtosis

Data
     sfb2.yld       treasury spot rates (see adlec1.m)
     dmr.txt        DM swap rates (see dmrates.m)

Option procedures
     opbs.m         Black-Scholes option prices
     ivbs.m         implied volatility from Black-Scholes
     cdfnor.m       cumulative std normal cdf
     plusop.m       compute "x+" = max(x,0) of a matrix

Binomial procedures

     treetest.m     runs various tree programs
     treehl.m       generates Ho-Lee rate tree from parameters
     treebdt.m      generates Black-Derman-Toy rate tree from parameters
     r2ybi.m        computes spot rates from short rate tree
     d2qbi.m        computes state prices from rate tree
     calmubi.m      finds drift parameters to fit current spot rates
     pathbi.m       computes price tree from cash flows and rate tree

Trinomial procedures
     coming !!!

generally provide help.  Good luck!
