  title = {Costly Financing, Optimal Payout Policies and the Valuation of Corporate
	Debt},
  year = {2000},
  abstract = {We present a cash-flow based model of corporate debt valuation that
	incorporates two novel features. First, we allow for the separation
	and optimal determination of the firm's debt-service and dividend
	policies; in particular, the firm is allowed to maintain cash reserves
	to meet future debt obligations. Second, our model admits the possibility
	that raising resources through issuance of new equity could be a
	costly procedure. In contrast, much of the previous literature has
	considered only dividend policies that are the residual consequences
	of debt-service policy, and has assumed new equity issuance costs
	are either zero or infinite.
	
	
	We provide an analytical characterization of equilibrium behavior
	in our model. Numerical analysis of the equilibrium reveals that
	our model predicts substantially higher yield spreads than the canonical
	Merton-type model. More importantly, we find that the two novel features
	of our model are crucial determinants of not only the overall spreads
	that result but also of the marginal impact of allowing for debt-service
	to be strategic. Specifically: (a) assuming residual rather than
	optimal dividend policies can result in a significant upward bias
	in the yield spreads predicted by the model; (b) the size of this
	bias depends in a central way on the costs of equity issuance; (c)
	the marginal impact of strategic debt-service is substantial, in
	general, only for low equity-issuance costs, and (d) under optimally-determined
	dividends, strategic debt-service can actually result in a narrowing
	of yield spreads. In summary, our results indicate that endogenizing
	dividend policy and allowing for equity-issuance costs can enhance
	the model's content substantially, while ignoring these factors could
	introduce non-trivial biases into the valuation.},

  title = {Yield Curve Modelling at the Bank of Canada},
  institution = {Bank of Canada},
  year = {1999},
  number = {84},
  abstract = {The primary objective of this paper is to produce a framework that
	could be
	
	used to construct a historical data base of zero-coupon and forward
	yield curves
	
	estimated from Government of Canada securities’ prices. The secondary
	objective
	
	is to better understand the behaviour of a class of parametric yield
	curve models,
	
	specifically, the Nelson-Siegel and the Svensson methodologies. These
	models
	
	specify a functional form for the instantaneous forward interest rate,
	and the user
	
	must determine the function parameters that are consistent with market
	prices for
	
	government debt. The results of these models are compared with those
	of a yield
	
	curve model used by the Bank of Canada for the last 15 years. The
	Bank of Canada’s
	
	existing model, based on an approach developed by Bell Canada, fits
	a socalled
	
	“par yield” curve to bond yields to maturity and subsequently extracts
	zerocoupon
	
	and “implied forward” rates. Given the pragmatic objectives of this
	
	research, the analysis focuses on the practical and deals with two
	key problems: the
	
	estimation problem (the choice of the best yield curve model and the
	optimization
	
	of its parameters); and the data problem (the selection of the appropriate
	set of market
	
	data). In the absence of a developed literature dealing with the practical
	side of
	
	parametric term structure estimation, this paper provides some guidance
	for those
	
	wishing to use parametric models under “real world” constraints.
	
	
	In the analysis of the estimation problem, the data filtering criteria
	are held
	
	constant (this is the “benchmark” case). Three separate models, two
	alternative
	
	specifications of the objective function, and two global search algorithms
	are examined.
	
	Each of these nine alternatives is summarized in terms of goodness
	of fit,
	
	speed of estimation, and robustness of the results. The best alternative
	is the Svensson
	
	model using a price-error-based, log-likelihood objective function
	and a global
	
	search algorithm that estimates subsets of parameters in stages. This
	estimation
	
	approach is used to consider the data problem. The authors look at
	a number of
	
	alternative data filtering settings, which include a more severe or
	“tight” setting and
	
	an examination of the use of bonds and/or treasury bills to model
	the short-end of
	
	the term structure. Once again, the goodness of fit, robustness, and
	speed of estimation
	
	are used to compare these different filtering possibilities. In the
	final analysis,
	
	it is decided that the benchmark filtering setting offers the most
	balanced approach
	
	to the selection of data for the estimation of the term structure.
	
	
	This work improves the understanding of this class of parametric models
	
	and will be used for the development of a historical data base of
	estimated term
	
	structures. In particular, a number of concerns about these models
	have been
	
	resolved by this analysis. For example, the authors believe that the
	log-likelihood
	
	specification of the objective function is an efficient approach to
	solving the estimation
	
	problem. In addition, the benchmark data filtering case performs well
	relative
	
	to other possible filtering scenarios. Indeed, this parametric class
	of models
	
	appears to be less sensitive to the data filtering than initially
	believed. However,
	
	some questions remain; specifically, the estimation algorithms could
	be improved.
	
	The authors are concerned that they do not consider enough of the
	domain of the
	
	objective function to determine the optimal set of starting parameters.
	Finally,
	
	although it was decided to employ the Svensson model, there are other
	functional
	
	forms that could be more stable or better describe the underlying
	data. These two
	
	remaining questions suggest that there are certainly more research
	issues to be
	
	explored in this area.},

	can choose both the
	
	amount and maturity of its debt. Bankruptcy is determined endogenously
	rather
	
	than by the imposition of a positive net worth condition or by a cash
	flow constraint.
	
	The results extend Leland's (1994a) closed-form results to a much
	richer class of
	
	possible debt structures and permit study of the optimal maturity
	of debt as well as
	
	the optimal amount of debt. The model predicts leverage, credit spreads,
	default
	
	rates, and writedowns, which accord quite closely with historical
	averages. While
	
	short term debt does not exploit tax benefits as completely as long
	term debt, it is
	
	more likely to provide incentive compatibility between debt holders
	and equity
	
	holders. Short term debt reduces or eliminates "asset substitution"
	agency costs. The
	
	tax advantage of debt must be balanced against bankruptcy and agency
	costs in
	
	determining the optimal maturity of the capital structure. The model
	predicts differently
	
	shaped term structures of credit spreads for different levels of risk.
	These
	
	term structures are similar to those found empirically by Sang and
	Warga (1989).
	
	Our results have important implications for bond portfolio management.
	In general,
	
	Macaulay duration dramatically overstates true duration of risky debt,
	which may be
	
	negative for "junk bonds. Furthermore, the "convexity" of bond prices
	can become
	
	"concavity."},
